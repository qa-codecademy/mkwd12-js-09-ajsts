# Module plan - Intro to Angular

We are getting started with Angular and we will be using the Angular CLI to create a new project. We will also be using the Angular CLI to add a new component to our project. We will create couple of components to showcase different Angular features, and to get familiar with older and modern Angular syntax.

## Commands to run

1. sudo npm install -g @angular/cli
2. ng new hotel-management
3. choose CSS
4. SSR? - No
5. cd hotel-management
6. ng serve --open
