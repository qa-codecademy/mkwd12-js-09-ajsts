# Module plan - Forms

In this module we will learn about the forms in Angular though building the sign up form for new guests in our hotel management app. We will also learn about the validation of the form fields and how to handle errors. We will see different between single form controls and form groups.

Within this module we will showcase some advanced rxjs operators. Example: Creating a new guest, and after getting a successful response, we will create a booking for the guest in a single stream.

We are going to build the new component for Room Details page, where we will showcase the usage of ngClass to display conditional styles. After that, are also going to use the `YesNoPipe` to convert a boolean value to a string, which is simple example of creating and using a custom pipe.

And last we create the guests page, were we display the list of guests, and we will also display the bookings of each guest.

## Commands to run

1. ng generate service booking
2. ng generate service guest
