# Homework 2 - Building an Angular App (Car Dealership)

###### Deadline: 22.08.2024 

## Task 1: Add routing

Routing is needed to reach to the following routes:

1. "/" - Homepage page with a list of cars for sale
2. "/about" - Information about the Car Dealership
3. "/contact" - Contact information, email, phone number, address etc.
4. "/cars/:id" - Page with details about a specific car - Create a new component for this page, show all data about the car in the page. We will reach this page by clicking on some car from the homepage (e.g. some link, button, clicking on the image, title, etc.)

## Task 2: Add ability to filter cars

Add a filter for cars by brand, model, year, color, etc. Add ability to add filter/search by at least 5 different attributes.

Bonus: Add ability to filter by all attributes at once.
